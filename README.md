HTML (index.html)
1. Modern, accessible, and responsive across devices

2. Split CSS into base.css and layout.css
 - base.css = design tokens, colors, spacing, resets
 - layout.css = structural rules (grid, panels, canvas)
This makes the project easier to scale and maintainability

3. Controls in footer (themeToggle, randomize)
 - Footer has secondary actions. Randomize button starts disabled until ready.

CSS (base.css)
1. Design tokens with :root variables
 - Define --bg, --text, --accent, --radius, etc.
